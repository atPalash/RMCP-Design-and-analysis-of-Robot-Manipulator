# Robotic Toolbox to design and analyse a manipulator

## Objective
Design a PUMA robot (6axis, RRRRRR) to reach target points as defined below:

The robot must be able to reach a work piece into different positions and orientations, A and B, see Figure above. Notice that the fingers of the gripper must be aligned with the black stripes of the work pieces of Figure above. 

## Implementation
We used robotic toolbox to compute the the joint angles (inverse kinematic) required to reach the required points, the result is shown below:
